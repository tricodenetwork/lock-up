/* Recommendations */

/*  
    - When applying, participants submit their preferred payment methods and the average time they take 
      to send or receive funds.
    - If a participant does not wish to receive SUI as payment, they must lock up the SUI equivalent in 
      escrow. This ensures the sender's ability to complete the transaction reliably.
    - Users / Applicants can filter for payment methods, currency, and then type of transaction (sending / receiving). 
      This can help find if a singular participant can complete the transaction.
    -   Incentivize users and participants my rewarding them the `lockup` token for using the platform.
*/

/* Actions on the platform */
/*
    - Sending :- 
        This is a User who wants to send money through the platform. 
        The `applicant` would need to:
            1. Select a payment method, the amount, and the currency to send.
            2. Pick a participant from the list of available matches who is willing to facilitate the transaction.
            3. Provide the recipient's payment details, including their preferred method and account information.
            4. Make payments and wait for the participant to complete the transaction to the recipient.

    - Receiving :- 
        This is a User who wants to receive money from another country through the platform. 
        The `applicant` would need to:
            1. Select a payment method and the desired currency to receive.
            2. Pick a participant from the list of available matches who is willing to facilitate the transaction.
            3. Once the `receiver` confirms the payment, SUI is locked up on the platform.
            4. `Applicant` can choose to cash out directly as SUI or indirectly as any preferred currency using the 
                Sending action.

    - Receiver :-
        This is a participant who wants to receive money on behalf of others on the platform.
        The `receiver` would need to:
            1. Log in to the platform and apply to be a receiver.
            2. Fill in details of different available payment methods in which the `receiver` can receive money, 
               along with the average time it takes for the receiver to process the money and the currencies they support.
            3. Lock up SUI and indicate that they are online and ready to receive a particular range of money. 
               `Receiver` cannot lock up less than the amount they intend to process. The more SUI locked up, the higher the 
               amount they can receive.
            4. Once the receiver confirms the payment, the fiat amount in SUI would be deducted from the user's balance.

    - Sender :-
        This is a participant who wants to send money on behalf of others on the platform. 
        The `sender` would need to:
            1. Log in to the platform and apply to be a sender.
            2. Fill in details of their available payment methods and currencies, including the average time it takes 
               them to process outgoing payments.
            3.  Indicate they are online and available to send by selecting range of amount and currencies the can send.
            4. Once a transaction is matched, the sender is notified and must confirm when the payment to the recipient 
               has been successfully processed.
            5. Upon confirmation, the equivalent amount of  SUI is released to the sender, and the transaction is marked as completed.
